# Collateral Ratio & Liquidation Threshold (DeFi & Aave)

## üìò What Is **Collateral Ratio**?

The **collateral ratio** (also known as **Loan-to-Value ratio** or **LTV**) is a financial metric that represents how much you can **borrow** relative to the **value of the collateral** you‚Äôve supplied.

---

### üîπ Formula:

```
Collateral Ratio = (Value of Collateral / Value of Loan) √ó 100

Loan-to-Value (LTV) = (Value of Loan / Value of Collateral) √ó 100
```

---

### üîç In Practice:

If you deposit **$1,000** worth of ETH into a lending platform like **Aave**, and it allows an **LTV of 75%**, you can borrow:

```
$1,000 √ó 75% = $750
```

So:
- **Collateral ratio = 1,000 / 750 = 1.33 (or 133%)**
- This means your collateral is worth **133%** of your loan.

---

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters:

- A **higher collateral ratio** means a **safer** position.
- If your collateral ratio falls below the platform's **liquidation threshold**, your position is at risk of being **partially liquidated**.
- Maintaining a **healthy buffer** above the liquidation threshold helps protect your assets from being sold off.

## üîÅ Collateral Ratio vs. Liquidation Threshold

| Term                      | Purpose                        | Trigger                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **LTV (Collateral Ratio)** | How much you can borrow        | At loan creation             |
| **Liquidation Threshold**  | When liquidation risk starts   | Ongoing, based on price changes |

---

## üîª What is Liquidation Threshold?

The **liquidation threshold** is the **percentage of collateral value** at which your position becomes **eligible for liquidation**.

Always **higher than LTV** to give a safety buffer.

If the value of your collateral falls such that your **debt exceeds the liquidation threshold**, part of your position may be **liquidated** by other users (liquidators).

---

### üßæ Example (ETH as Collateral on Aave v3 - as of mid-2024):

- **LTV**: 75%
- **Liquidation Threshold**: 80%
- **Liquidation Penalty**: ~5% (what liquidators earn when liquidating you)
